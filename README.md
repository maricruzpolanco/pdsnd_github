### Project Title
Explore U.S. Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used **Python 3.9** (**time**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, **calendar** libraries) to build an interactive environment where users can choose bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and/or Washington and filter the dataset to analyze and compute descriptive statistics for the chosen data as part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
